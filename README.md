# Current-Mood-Detection

This NLP Application works on the textual data of the users to get to the current mood of the person.
The models are well trained to the insight of the mood of a person for a specific category. Here in this project, 
we are working with the 9 sub levels of the moods that a person may get through.
These 9 Sub Categories are:
1. Depressed
2. Non-Depressed
3. Stress
4. No stress
5. Bipolar Disorder
6. Anxiety
7. Mental
8. Non-Mental
9. Personality Disorder


The first and the  most important task in this implementation is the combination of the dataset.
All these categories are individually monitored over various models, to have an integrated model to monitor all these, requires an intergrated dataset. 

Above python file named as "Psychology Part 1", explores and implement the same part of the research that goes on to integrate different datasets into a single dataset. 

There are many different ways to implement the research on the current mood detection. Looking at the type of data, that is textual data, I have implemented the research using the GRU architecture. The file for the same has been added. 
Processing different sequence of data through GRU, as GRUs are well know for their working over the sequence of the textual data. 
The performance matrix of the GRU has been shared in the added files of the repository. 

The file name Psychological Mood Detection(GRU) has been added in the repository that shows the implementation using GRU for the research work.
The implementation has been done in the python language. 

Image  folder cover all the visuals of the dataset. Various parameters of the categories has been shared through the graphs.

The python file named as "Psychology Using GRU" shows the implementation using GRU architecture.
