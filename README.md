# Current-Mood-Detection

This NLP Application works on the textual data of the users to get to the current mood of the person.
The models are well trained to the insight of the mood of a person for a specific category. Here in this project, 
we are working with the 9 sub levels of the moods that a person may get through.
These 9 Sub Categories are:
1. Depressed
2. Non-Depressed
3. Stress
4. No stress
5. Bipolar Disorder
6. Anxiety
7. Mental
8. Non-Mental
9. Personality Disorder


The first and the  most important task in this implementation is the combination of the dataset.
All these categories are individually monitored over various models, to have an integrated model to monitor all these, requires an intergrated dataset. 

Above python file named as "Psychology Part 1", explores and implement the same part of the research that goes on to integrate different datasets into a single dataset.
